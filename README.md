## 🤔 What is Mappable?
Mappable is a web app that helps increase students' engagement in school communities by monitoring engagement and attendance at events organized by educators. Teachers and students can accumulate points and gems for attending events and organizing events which allow users to redeem incentives in gems currency. Every quarter, a report and leaderboard are generated to indicate how everyone has fared in terms of statistics; these can give students with rewards. In the web app, users can also create Spaces, which enable them to connect and discuss the development and rostering of school-related events. To improve productivity of the users, there is an notification system so users can instantly respond to actions happening within the app without any time to waste.
